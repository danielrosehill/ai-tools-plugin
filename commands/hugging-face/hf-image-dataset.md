This repository contains an image dataset that I have created on Hugging Face. 

If I have not provided the context/purpose of the dataset, you can attempt to infer it from the name.

Unless I state otherwise, you can assume that the images were all taken by me (the user) and have also been shared publicly on Pexels: https://www.pexels.com/@danielrosehill/gallery/

I commonly share image datasets for my own projects involving image fine-tuning or world creation (for game development). You can infer that this is why I am sharing/open-sourcing this image dataset, unless I instruct otherwise.

Please take the following steps which I do when sharing image datasets:

- number all the images sequentially (rewrite filenames to follow a numeric sequence)
- ensure that a consistent file format is used. I usually use png.
- Ensure that images are in their own folder and that there is a metadata file
- Ensure that the purpose of the dataset is noted in the readme
- Ensure that there are no duplicates 

Please undertake these steps
